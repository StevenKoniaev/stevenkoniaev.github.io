# [Similarity of Languages](COMP_550_Final_Project.pdf)
Python, PyTorch, Numpy

- We analyze the complexity and relationship between different languages compared to English via Machine Translation.
-  We explored common challenges in Machine Translation, including model complexity, data cleaning, and computational limits.

# [TicTacToe RL](COMP_579.pdf)
Python, PyTorch, Numpy

 - We investigated the performance of two reinforcement learning models in multi-agent sparse reward environments. 
 - With our limited compute we focused on Connect 4 using Deep Q-Networks and Actor-Critic algorithms. 
 - We implemented both models from scratch along with several variations. Our results demonstrated that both algorithms can learn these games given sufficient training time, although the efficiency of training varies significantly with different modifications to the algorithms.

# [Due by Daylight](https://github.com/xen-42/mcgill-ugl-2022?tab=readme-ov-file) - Ubisoft Gamelabs
Unity, C#

- Collaborated with a team of McGill students to complete a game prototype in a semester, working alongside
Ubisoft employees.
- The result was a two player, online multiplayer game built in Unity which incorporated multiplayer elements.
- Teams across Montreal came together, shared, and played each others games at the end of the semester.
